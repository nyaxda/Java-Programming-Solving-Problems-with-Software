## Assignments Overview üìù
### StringsFirstAssignment
This assignment focuses on basic string manipulation techniques. You will learn:
- How to find substrings within a string.
- How to replace characters in a string.
- How to convert strings to different cases.

#### Example Snippet:
```java
public class Part1 {
    public String findSimpleGene(String dna) {
        // ...existing code...
    }
}
```

### StringsSecondAssignment
This assignment builds on the first by introducing more complex string operations. You will learn:
- How to use regular expressions for pattern matching.
- How to split strings based on delimiters.
- How to parse strings into different data types.

#### Example Snippet:
```java
public class Part2 {
    public String findGene(String dna, String startCodon, String stopCodon) {
        // ...existing code...
    }
}
```

### StringsThirdAssignment
This assignment involves working with real-world data and performing string manipulations to extract meaningful information. You will learn:
- How to read data from files.
- How to process and analyze text data.
- How to generate summaries and reports from text data.

#### Example Snippet:
```java
public class Part3 {
    public void processGenes(StorageResource sr) {
        // ...existing code...
    }
}
```
